# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Used python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I imported the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
